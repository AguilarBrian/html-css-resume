# HTML/CSS Static Page Resume

These were my _first steps_ in HTML and CSS a while ago.<br/>
It's just a static HTML page with basic CSS styles.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to keep all the code as it was.<br/>
Just updated my personal data which is displayed in the HTML file.<br/>
<br/>
**Open the HTML on your browser and take a look!**
